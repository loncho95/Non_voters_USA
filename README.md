# Non voters USA (Project 3)
## About
Analyzing the behavior and opinions of US citizens leading up to the upcoming elections is an important and relevant topic for several reasons.
Firstly, the US is one of the largest democracies in the world, and its political system has a significant impact on the global political landscape. Understanding the preferences and opinions of US citizens can help us gain insight into the political climate of the country, and the potential impact of the election outcomes on domestic and international affairs.
Secondly, analyzing the behavior and opinions of US citizens can help political parties, candidates, and policymakers tailor their campaigns and policies to better align with the needs and expectations of voters. By understanding what issues are most important to voters, for example, political parties can develop more effective platforms that resonate with the electorate.
Finally, understanding the behavior and opinions of US citizens is important for promoting democratic values and principles. In a democracy, it is essential that citizens are informed and engaged in the political process. By analyzing their behavior and opinions, we can identify areas where there may be a lack of understanding or engagement, and develop strategies to encourage greater participation and civic engagement.
Overall, analyzing the behavior and opinions of US citizens leading up to the elections is an important and timely topic that has significant implications for the country and the world at large.

## Repository description
### Selecting a topic 
Given that the elections in the US are approaching we have decided analyze the behavior and opinions of the US citizens.
### Finding a dataset 
We have selected a survey conducted Ipsos’s KnowledgePanel, a probability-based online panel that is recruited to be representative of the U.S. population. The poll was conducted from Sept. 15 to Sept. 25 among a sample of U.S. citizens that oversampled young, Black and Hispanic respondents, with 8,327 respondents, and was weighted according to general population benchmarks for U.S. citizens from the U.S. Census Bureau’s Current Population Survey March 2019 Supplement. The voter file company Aristotle then matched respondents to a voter file to more accurately understand their voting history using the panelist’s first name, last name, zip code, and eight characters of their address, using the National Change of Address program if applicable. Sixty-four percent of the sample (5,355 respondents) matched, although we also included respondents who did not match the voter file but described themselves as voting “rarely” or “never” in our survey, so as to avoid underrepresenting nonvoters, who are less likely to be included in the voter file to begin with. We dropped respondents who were only eligible to vote in three elections or fewer.

### The *Non_voters_USA* project displays:
This repository showcases a mini-project where we utilized JavaScript and HTML to create interactive data visualizations. The project is powered by an API that integrates Python for efficient data structuring, and various end routes were used to achieve the desirable format of the JSONs. Previously, ERD was defined, then the schema was queried in SQL (pg admin) and we employed SQLalchemy to reflect the database in our API, created with Flask.
